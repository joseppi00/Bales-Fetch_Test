# Bales-Fetch_Test

Hello! In the main-branch of this repository are two files:

1) The first-step image file just shows the keys I use to communicate between each of the csv files.
2) The submission zip file contains both an rmarkdown file of my original code and the pdf output of my answer to questions two and three.

I haven't had ample reason in the past to learn SQL. For that reason, I answered questions for the stakeholders using the tools I do have and can use proficiently. Learning SQL would not be an issue for this internship, but for purposes of applying, I currently stuck with coding in R.

Thank you for your consideration!

Best,
Gary Bales
